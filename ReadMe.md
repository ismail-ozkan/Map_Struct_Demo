# MapStruct Dependency

## What is MapStruct?

MapStruct is a code generator that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention over configuration approach.

## Maven Dependency

To use MapStruct in your project, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mapstruct</groupId>
    <artifactId>mapstruct</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.5.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

## Features

- **Object Mapping**: Automatically map between different class types like DTOs, Entities, and other custom objects.
- **Clean Code**: Simplifies complex mapping logic, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with Maven-based Java projects.
